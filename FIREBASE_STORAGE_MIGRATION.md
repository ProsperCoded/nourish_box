# Firebase Storage Migration

## Overview

Successfully migrated from **Cloudinary** to **Firebase Storage** for all image and video uploads in the Nourish Box application.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Firebase Storage Service

- **File**: `app/api/storage/firebase-storage.service.ts`
- Implements upload, delete, and utility methods for Firebase Storage
- Supports both images and videos
- Generates unique file names with UUID to prevent conflicts
- Proper error handling and logging

### 2. Updated Storage Service

- **File**: `app/api/storage/storage.service.ts`
- Now uses Firebase Storage service instead of Cloudinary
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing API
- Removed Cloudinary dependencies

### 3. Frontend Firebase Storage Utils

- **File**: `app/utils/firebase/storage.firebase.ts`
- Frontend utilities for direct Firebase Storage operations
- Includes file upload, delete, and preview functions
- Optimized for client-side usage

### 4. Updated Admin Recipes Management

- **File**: `app/admin/recipes/page.tsx`
- Updated deletion logic to use new Firebase Storage service
- Proper cleanup of both display media and sample media
- Better error handling

### 5. Updated Recipe Type Definition

- **File**: `app/utils/types/recipe.type.ts`
- Fixed duration type from string to number
- Proper media structure with publicId and type fields

## File Storage Structure

Firebase Storage files are organized as follows:

```
nourish_box/
├── images/
│   └── filename_uuid.ext
└── videos/
    └── filename_uuid.ext
```

## Upload Flow

### API Upload (for admin operations)

1. File received by `/api/recipes/upload-media`
2. Converted to buffer and passed to `firebaseStorageService.uploadMedia()`
3. File uploaded to Firebase Storage with unique name
4. Returns downloadable URL and storage path (publicId)

### Frontend Upload (for direct operations)

1. Use `uploadFile()` from `app/utils/firebase/storage.firebase.ts`
2. File uploaded directly from frontend
3. Returns UploadResult with URL, publicId, and type

## Benefits of Migration

1. **Cost Effective**: Firebase Storage pricing is often more economical
2. **Integrated Ecosystem**: Better integration with existing Firebase setup
3. **Security**: Uses Firebase security rules and authentication
4. **Scalability**: Automatic scaling with Firebase infrastructure
5. **Simplified Architecture**: One less third-party service to manage

## Environment Variables

The migration uses existing Firebase configuration from `app/api/utils/config.env.ts`:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`
- Other Firebase config variables already in place

## API Compatibility

The migration maintains full backward compatibility:

- Same API endpoints (`/api/recipes/upload-media`)
- Same response format
- Same error handling patterns

## Testing

Ensure to test:

1. Recipe creation with image uploads ✅
2. Recipe creation with video uploads ✅
3. Recipe editing with media replacement ✅
4. Recipe deletion with media cleanup ✅
5. Sample image uploads ✅
6. Error handling for failed uploads ✅

## Cleanup

Removed dependencies:

- Cloudinary SDK imports
- Cloudinary configuration usage
- Direct Firebase Storage imports in admin components (replaced with service layer)

## Next Steps

1. Remove Cloudinary environment variables from production
2. Update deployment scripts if needed
3. Monitor Firebase Storage usage and costs
4. Consider implementing Firebase Storage security rules for additional protection
